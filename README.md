# gymico
Gymico is a training app which prodives users to do exercises at home.In this app, 
we provide users to choose their programs according to their wishes such as gaining 
muscle ,lossing weight and getting ready for summer.For information part , we’re 
influenced by the written things as you know these on the walls at gyms which give 
motivation to users.Moreover , since this is an app for being healthy and fit , we 
want our users to calculate their own bmı’s to decide which program can the best 
one for them be.

For admin panel, we want to pursue our users from the app without going through 
the firebase.Thanks to admin panel , we can see their information such as which 
program they’re doing , their bmı and goal weight etc.Furthermore , we can control 
all the exercise programs.
